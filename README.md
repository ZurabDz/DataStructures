# DataStructures

This repo has **only** educational purposes and is **no way close to actual implementations of given DataStructures or Containers.** For starters I'm going to be
concerned with 'enough' degree of correctness, but later would be great to add some fancy variadic templates, iterators and much more.


### Planning to implement:
* Lists
  * Single Linked List
  * Double Linked List
  * Circular Linked List
* Maps
  * Ordered and unordered maps
* Sets
  * Ordered and unordered sets
* Trees
  * Binary Tree
  * Red Black Tree
  * AVL Tree
